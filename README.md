# My PhD, but AI

An experiment to understand the research, deep-reasoning and coding capabilities of different AI agents in GitHub copilot.

I completed my PhD between 2004-2008.  It was entirely focused on numerical modelling and I wrote a lot of F77, F90 and C++ code (as well as bash scripts, Makefiles, R scripts etc. etc.)

A lot has changed since then; the iPhone didn't exist when I started my PhD for example! Now - since GPT 3.5 anyway - the rise of AI copilots and now AI agents has revolutionised software development (and perhaps software engineering - but we'll investigate that.)  In this repo, I have provide instructions for AI agents to replicate the simulation code I created for my PhD (see SPEC.md.)  I have not provided much technicl detail; just enough for the agent to search the internet and find the relevant papers (and the code if it exists - this was before GitHub existed after all!)

The three artefacts provided to the agent:
  1. PROMPT.md - the prompt used to initiate the agent's development attempt.
  2. SPEC.md - the problem statement and expected outcomes.
  3. DEVGUIDE.md - ruleset the agent must follow when developing software.

That's it.  I'll execute the same prompt with different agents and save the results on corresponding repo branches.  The main branch will only store instructions.

## Results
