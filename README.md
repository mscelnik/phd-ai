# phd-ai (educational simplified reimplementation)

This repository contains a compact, educational Python reimplementation of
an old PhD codebase for soot / nanoparticle formation. The implementation is
intentionally simplified for clarity and automated testing.

Quickstart

1. Create and activate a venv:

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the example simulation:

```bash
python bin/run_sim.py config/example_config.yml
```

Outputs are written to the `outputs/` directory.
