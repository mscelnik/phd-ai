# Reference inventory

1. [Wikipedia: Soot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soot) — offers a top-level summary of soot formation pathways, nucleation, surface growth, and phenomenological vs detailed chemistry models.
2. [Wikipedia: Acetylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylene) — documents the molecule's physical properties, combustion reactions, and industrial generation routes that inspired the simplified kinetic scheme.
3. Local extraction files: `refs/soot_notes.md` and `refs/acetylene_notes.md` capture the distilled context used when crafting the reaction network and Monte Carlo rules.
