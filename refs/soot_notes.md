# Soot modeling notes

- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soot (last accessed Feb 2026).
- Key takeaways:
  - Soot forms from precursor species such as acetylene and PAHs during incomplete combustion.
  - Mechanism descriptions emphasize nucleation, surface growth, coagulation, and oxidation, which guided the Monte Carlo kernel.
  - Phenomenological models combine explicit chemistry and calibrated sub-models, so we keep the particle model semi-empirical and tied to acetylene concentration.
