Good evening.  I want you to create a entire Python program for me.  This may take some time, but keep calm and get it right the first time.  I have provided a specification in the SPEC.md file - I appreciate this doesn't provide a lot of technical detail, but I expect you to find the necessary information from the web.  Follow the spec and create the necessary repository and files.  Use Python and set up a .venv for testing.  Download necessary input data and store in data/.  Test everything; follow the DEVGUIDE at all times.  Good luck!
