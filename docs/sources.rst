Reference material
==================

The implementation leans on authoritative summaries of soot and acetylene chemistry:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soot (provides a compact overview of soot formation, phenomenological models, and soot hazards).
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylene (supplies physical and chemical properties of acetylene and a list of combustion pathways).

Full citations and downloaded notes live under `refs/` so you can trace every assumption in the solver.
